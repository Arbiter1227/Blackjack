Please credit me if you use any of the code in here (as if).
  
# Guide  
If you've never played Blackjack (or "21", as it's occasionally called), this is a brief guide explaining the basics.  
## Winning  
The idea of the game is to draw random cards (which represent points) from a deck and whoever's score is closest to 21 (without going over) wins.
## Terms  
- Hit  
To "hit" means to ask for a new card. Aces are worth 1 point, a 2 is worth 2 points, and so on. Cards that have faces (i.e. kings, jacks, queens) are all worth 10 points.  
- Stand  
To "stand" means to end your turn...permanently. Once you think that your score is close enough to 21, you should "stand" and skip your turns. However, you cannot un-stand, so make sure that you're very close before standing (around 16-21 points is a good range to stand).  
# About  
Now that you understand the game, here's some info about the code.
## Bugs  
So far, I've only found one.  
If you stand on your first turn (which you should never, BTW), it does some wacky things.  
## AI   
The Enemy AI will automatically stand if it's score is higher than 15.  
Use this info to your advantage.  
## Forks  
Not much to add here, so IDK.
